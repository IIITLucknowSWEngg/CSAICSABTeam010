## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- **Response Time**: 
   - The website should respond to user interactions (e.g., page loads, form submissions) within **2 seconds** under normal load conditions. 
   - This is crucial to maintaining a positive user experience, especially for users with slower internet connections or devices. Faster response times improve overall satisfaction and reduce bounce rates.
  
- **Concurrent Users**: 
   - The system must be able to handle up to **10,000 concurrent users per server** without any noticeable performance degradation. 
   - Load testing will be conducted to ensure the platform can handle high user activity, especially during peak shopping times like holiday sales or special promotions.

### 4.2 Usability
- **User-Friendly Navigation**:
   - The website should have an intuitive layout and navigation system that allows both beginners and expert users to easily find products, manage their accounts, and complete transactions.

   - All sensitive data transmitted between the client and the server (such as payment details, personal information, etc.) should be encrypted using **end-to-end encryption** to protect user privacy and prevent data breaches.
   - The system should use **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** for data in transit and **AES-256** encryption for data at rest to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - The platform should implement **RBAC** for admin and supplier accounts, ensuring that users only have access to the features and data that are relevant to their roles.
   - Admins will have full access to all system settings, while suppliers will only have access to their product inventory and order information.

### 4.4 Reliability
- **Uptime**:
   - The system must achieve a **99.9% uptime** per month, ensuring that the platform is always available for users.
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b741ceea-6826-4cb1-9cab-75f7fd0491e9)

   - Downtime due to maintenance should be scheduled during low-traffic hours and communicated in advance to minimize impact.

- **Failover and Redundancy**:
   - Automated **failover mechanisms** should be in place to switch traffic to backup servers in case of a failure in the primary server.
   - This ensures that users can continue interacting with the website without interruption even if one server goes down.

- **Real-Time Backups**:
   - The system should conduct **real-time backups** to ensure that user data, transactions, and inventory information is protected from data loss.
   - Backups should be stored in geographically distributed data centers for redundancy and to provide quick recovery in case of disaster.

### 4.5 Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - The system should support **horizontal scaling**, meaning it can handle increased load by adding more servers to the infrastructure. This is essential for handling traffic spikes, such as during flash sales or peak shopping seasons.
   - Load balancing should be used to distribute incoming traffic evenly across servers to ensure optimal performance.

- **Caching Mechanisms**:
   - The platform should implement **efficient caching mechanisms** for frequently accessed resources, such as product details, user profiles, and shopping cart data.
   - This will help reduce the load on the backend servers and improve response times for end-users.
     
### 4.6 Compatibility
- **Browser Compatibility**:
   - The website must be fully compatible with the latest versions of major browsers, including **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, and **Edge**. 
   - This ensures that all users have a consistent and seamless experience regardless of their choice of browser.

- **Mobile-First Design**:
   - The platform must have a **mobile-first design**, meaning it should be optimized for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) before being adapted for desktops.
   - The design should be responsive, ensuring that the site adapts to different screen sizes without compromising the user experience.

### 4.7 Localization
- **Language Switching**:
   - The platform should provide **smooth language switching** without layout disruptions. Users should be able to easily switch between languages from the website’s header or footer.
